Battery Peak Shaving
We have a file named "veri.mat"
received in the working period of the ship.
We have 1 value for twice the time of a second. 
I filtered this data through a pre-filter to make it organized. 
This filter will not be on these repositories. Using this data, if a battery other than the generator is added,
it will help to us find the required battery in the % value of this period.
